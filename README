# Wintermute [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute.png)](http://waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/jalcine/wintermute/badge.png?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/r/jalcine/wintermute?branch=develop) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/wintermute.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/wintermute)

Wintermute is an extensible application that aims to become the foundation of 
an **artificial intelligence framework**. The application is written in C++ at 
its core but hopes are made to extend the platform to work with **Ruby**, 
**Python**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Scala**, **Lua**, **Haskell** and
**Go** (not in that exact order!). It'd be awesome!

## Installing

Installing? **Easy**. We use [CMake](http://cmake.org); we gotcha. But read
[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for more information.

## Tested Operating Systems
So far, Wintermute has only been built and tested on a Linux operating system,
more precisely, running [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org) Raring Ringtail 13.04.
Please build, test and upload your results for comparsion!
